abstract: "Collaborative and immersive environments both contribute to increasing engagement in video-based learning (VBL). This exploratory study delves into the dynamics of interaction forms within collaborative VR video-based learning and evaluates how shared and individual video control influence these interactions. Through a within-subject study involving 18 groups of three participants (N = 54), we aim to address three research questions: identifying interaction forms in collaborative VR video-based learning, comparing interaction forms between shared and individual video control, and examining the relationship between interaction forms and knowledge acquisition and satisfaction."
summary: "This paper investigates what happens when small groups of learners watch educational videos together in virtual reality, comparing whether giving everyone their own playback controls versus sharing a single set of controls changes how they interact and learn. The study with 54 participants reveals distinct patterns of collaboration and offers guidance for designing group VR learning tools that balance individual agency with shared experience."
