abstract: "Virtual reality (VR) offers promise in education given its immersive and socially engaging nature, but it can pose challenges for educators when creating VR-specific content. VR videos can function as a new educational tool for VR content creation due to their creation affordability and user-friendliness. However, little empirical research exists on how educators utilize VR videos and associated pedagogy in real classes. Our research employed a contextual inquiry, through in-person interviews and online surveys with 11 instructors to gain actionable insights from envisioned teaching scenarios for VR videos that are informed by actual instructional practices. Our study aims to understand the factors that motivate instructors' adoption of VR videos, identify challenges educators face when incorporating VR videos into instructional units, and examine pedagogical adjustments when integrating VR videos into teaching. Through empirical evidence, we provide design implications for the development of VR-based learning experiences across diverse educational contexts."
summary: "This study goes into real classrooms to learn how university instructors actually think about using VR video in their teaching, rather than testing a prototype in a lab. Interviews and surveys with 11 instructors reveal what motivates them to adopt VR video, the practical hurdles they face, and the pedagogical changes they need to make -- offering concrete guidance for tool designers."
