abstract: "Volumetric video is a medium that captures the three-dimensional (3D) shape and movement of real-life objects or people. However, pre-recorded volumetric video is limited in terms of interactivity. We introduce a novel authoring system called Volumivive, which enables the creation of interactive experiences using volumetric video, enhancing the dynamic capabilities and interactivity of the medium. We provide four interaction methods that allow users to manipulate and engage with digital objects within the volumetric video. These interactive experiences can be used in both augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) settings, providing users with a more immersive and interactive experience."
summary: "Volumivive is a creative tool that lets authors add clickable, manipulable elements on top of 3D video recordings of real people and objects. By bridging the gap between passive 3D footage and interactive AR/VR experiences, it opens the door for educators, storytellers, and designers to build engaging content without needing to create everything from scratch in 3D."
