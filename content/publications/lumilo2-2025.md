abstract: "This interactive event presents Lumilo 2, a scalable mixed reality (MR) orchestration tool designed to support real-time teacher intervention during student learning with intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Building on previous work that demonstrated significant learning gains with MR teacher orchestration tools, Lumilo 2 reimagines this technology for modern and lightweight MR devices (Xreal Air 2 Ultra). Beyond real-time awareness, Lumilo 2 scales across ITS platforms and classrooms, advancing the goal of making data-driven teacher support broadly accessible in real-world settings."
summary: "This paper presents Lumilo 2, lightweight mixed-reality glasses that let teachers see at a glance how each student is doing while they work with intelligent tutoring software, so the teacher can step in and help where it is needed most. By running on affordable, everyday-looking glasses and working across different tutoring platforms, Lumilo 2 makes this kind of real-time data-driven classroom support practical for widespread use."
