abstract: "Virtual Reality (VR) has a noteworthy educational potential by providing immersive and collaborative environments. As an alternative but cost-effective way of delivering realistic environments in VR, using 360-degree videos in immersive VR (VR videos) received more attention. Although many studies reported positive learning experiences with VR videos, little is known about how collaborative learning performs on VR video viewing systems. In this study, we implemented two collaborative VR video viewing modes based on the way of group video control, synchronized or shared (Sync mode) and non-synchronized or individual (Non-sync mode) video control, against a conventional VR video viewing setting (Basic mode). We conducted a within-subject study (N = 54) in a lab-simulated remote learning environment. Our results show that collaborative VR video modes (Sync and Non-sync mode) significantly improve learning outcomes and satisfaction compared to the Basic mode."
summary: "This study investigates whether letting remote learners watch 360-degree VR videos together, with shared or individual playback controls, improves education compared to watching alone. A 54-person experiment found that both collaborative viewing modes led to significantly better learning outcomes and higher satisfaction than solo viewing."
