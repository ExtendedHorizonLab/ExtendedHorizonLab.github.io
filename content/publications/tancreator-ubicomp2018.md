  In this paper, we present TanCreator, a tangible authoring tool which facilitates
  children to create games based on Augmented Reality (AR) and sensor technologies.
  Combining AR elements and sensors in games bridges virtual world with realistic
  surroundings closely together, providing more joyful and intuitive creating
  experiment for children. Children could boost their creativity via creating their
  own maze games in daily life with paper tokens and sensors. It is also great
  training for children's motor skills such as hand-eye coordination.
summary: "TanCreator gives children a hands-on way to design their own AR maze games using paper tokens and physical sensors, blending digital creativity with real-world play. By letting kids author interactive experiences rather than just consume them, the tool nurtures both creative thinking and fine motor skills like hand-eye coordination."
