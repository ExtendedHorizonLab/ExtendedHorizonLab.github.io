abstract: "This SIG will provide child-computer interaction researchers and practitioners, as well as other interested CSCW attendees, an opportunity to discuss topics related to the ethics of emerging communication and collaboration technologies for children. The child-computer interaction community has conducted many discussions on ethical issues, including a recent SIG at CHI 2023. However, the angle of communication and collaboration has not been a focus, even though emerging technologies could affect these aspects in significant ways. Hence, there is a need to consider emerging technologies, such as extended reality, and how they may impact the way children communicate and collaborate in face-to-face, remote, and hybrid (mixed-presence) contexts."
summary: "This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss the ethical challenges that new technologies like virtual and augmented reality pose for how children communicate and work together. It fills an important gap by focusing specifically on collaboration and communication risks for kids, areas that have been overlooked even as these technologies rapidly enter children's lives."
