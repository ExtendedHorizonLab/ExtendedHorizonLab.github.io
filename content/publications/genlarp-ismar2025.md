abstract: "We introduce GENLARP, a virtual reality (VR) system that transforms personalized stories into immersive live action role-playing (LARP) experiences. GenLARP enables users to act as both creators and players, allowing them to design characters based on their descriptions and live in the story world. Generative AI and agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) enrich these experiences."
summary: "This paper presents a VR system that lets users create and step into their own live-action role-playing adventures, using AI to generate responsive worlds and characters on the fly. By combining generative AI with immersive VR, GenLARP blurs the line between storytelling and gameplay, letting players both author and inhabit their narratives in real time."
