  In this paper we present ARCat, a tangible programming tool designed to help
  children learn Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm with augmented reality (AR)
  technology. With this tool, children could use tangible programming cards to
  control a search process, rather than control virtual characters directly. With
  the special design of card semantics and real-time feedback, the tool helps
  children understand the DFS algorithm in an intuitive and engaging way.
summary: "ARCat lets children learn a fundamental computer science algorithm (Depth First Search) by physically arranging cards on a table while augmented reality brings the search process to life. This hands-on approach makes an otherwise abstract concept accessible and fun for young learners."
