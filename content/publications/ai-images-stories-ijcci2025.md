abstract: "The growing availability of AI-generated images has opened new possibilities for children's storytelling. However, little is known about how children and parents perceive and evaluate AI-generated images in the context of stories. We conducted a study with children and parents to understand their needs and preferences for AI-generated images in stories, examining factors such as emotional expression, diversity, and visual quality."
summary: "This study explores what children and parents actually want from AI-generated illustrations in stories, finding that issues like awkward emotional expressions and lack of diversity matter a great deal. The findings offer practical guidance for designers building AI image tools aimed at young readers and their families."
