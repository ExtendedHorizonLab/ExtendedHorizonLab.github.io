abstract: "Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a transformative technology to revolutionize education, socialization, and entertainment. However, alongside its promising applications, concerns about potential risks, particularly for young children, have surfaced. We conducted a survey and interview study with 55 parents and 67 children aged 7-13, to identify ethical concerns and design considerations for VR usage in youth populations. This study contributes to the HCI community by providing empirical insights into the ethical concerns surrounding children's VR usage, as viewed from both children's and their parents' perspectives. These insights stem directly from their perceptions of the risks, benefits, and considerations associated with VR across various usage scenarios. Additionally, our research offers valuable design and research implications for the development of responsible VR practices that balance the advantages and potential risks for children and their families."
summary: "This award-winning study asks both kids and their parents what worries and excites them about virtual reality, drawing on surveys and interviews with over 120 participants to surface ethical concerns that designers often miss. The findings provide concrete guidance for building VR experiences that are safer and more appropriate for children, informed directly by the voices of families themselves."
