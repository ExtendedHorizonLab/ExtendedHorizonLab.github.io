abstract: "In order to cultivate children's computational thinking, researchers have developed many excellent programming systems. Among them, the tangible programming systems combined with graphic output have been widely accepted because of the intuitive input method and diversified visual feedback. However, few of them support collaborative learning or programming. Little is known about children's experiences, emotional states and behaviours on collaborative programming. Motivated by this gap, we present a novel tangible and collaborative enabled programming system named Lighters, which designed for children aged 7-10 and had two types of collaboration modes (block-based and role-based). We conducted a user experiment with 24 children, and collected physiological (EDA), questionnaire, video recording and interview data for analysis. Based on our experiment results, Lighters are effective in helping children learn to program collaboratively. In addition, Lighters can mobilize children's positive emotions and enthusiasm to learn programming. Compared with block-based collaboration, role-based collaboration is more likely to stimulate children's emotional states and has a better effect on learning programming."
summary: "This paper introduces Lighters, a hands-on programming system where children aged 7-10 use physical blocks to write programs together and see the results as light patterns. A study with 24 children found that assigning specific roles to collaborators led to stronger emotional engagement and better learning outcomes than simply sharing blocks, offering practical lessons for designing collaborative coding tools for young learners."
