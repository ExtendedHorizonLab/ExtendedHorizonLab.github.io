abstract: "Prior work has explored various technology designs to support intergenerational communications and connections through remote activities such as reading or play. However, few works have explored these technologies outside the family settings. In this work, we aimed to understand how technology can support social connectedness through remote activities, by investigating the use of a tablet-based AR system among older adult volunteers and students for remote reading. We developed the system based on insights from previous research, deployed the system in the field, and observed the use of the system over six months. With the data collected from the field, we present a rich description on the use of the system and the practices that emerged around its usage in a real-world setting. Our findings highlight the importance of supporting an engaging reading experience and context understanding for social connections with the technology design."
summary: "This paper reports on a six-month real-world deployment of a tablet-based augmented reality reading app that connects older adult volunteers with students for shared remote reading sessions. The study reveals how AR-enhanced reading can foster meaningful social bonds across generations, even outside of family relationships."
