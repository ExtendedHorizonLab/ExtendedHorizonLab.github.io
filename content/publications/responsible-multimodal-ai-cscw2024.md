abstract: "This SIG is primarily designed for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring the utilization of multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) to understand and analyze human behaviors across various domains. It will particularly benefit professionals in UX design and research, cognitive science, education, psychology, and data science who are pursuing innovative ways to integrate multimodal data with AI to gain deeper behavioral insights."
summary: "This Special Interest Group brings together researchers from UX, psychology, education, and data science to discuss how AI that processes multiple types of input -- such as text, video, and audio -- can be used responsibly to study human behavior. The goal is to establish shared guidelines and spark collaboration around ethical, multimodal approaches to behavioral analysis."
