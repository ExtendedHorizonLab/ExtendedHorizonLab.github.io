  Examining the values inherent in papers published at IDC provides a lens to our
  research community and informs the path of future research needs and opportunities.
  We conducted a content analysis of the values expressed in all full IDC papers
  between 2011 and 2019 and a survey with the first authors of 20% of these papers.
  We examine the types of IDC research contributions, the qualities and behaviors
  the research seeks to support in children, the role of the child and other
  stakeholders in the design process, the theories that inform IDC research, and
  the criteria that guide the technical design choices. We discuss the research
  contributions and the core value trends over the past two decades of IDC full
  published papers. We also present the ethical considerations central to the
  surveyed authors' work. Based on our analysis, we discuss implications and
  opportunities for future contributions, such as explicit attention to inclusivity
  in research, encouraging multidisciplinary collaborations, and expanding the
  qualities our community aims to support in children.
summary: "This paper takes a step back to ask what the Interaction Design and Children (IDC) research community truly values by analyzing nearly a decade of published work and surveying paper authors. The findings reveal trends in how researchers think about children's roles, ethics, and inclusivity, and suggest new directions such as broader multidisciplinary collaboration and more explicit attention to diversity in future child-centered technology research."
