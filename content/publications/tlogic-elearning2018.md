  In this paper, we present TLogic, a tangible programming tool for children aged
  6-8. The tool contains two parts: tangible programming blocks and visual tasks
  with different difficulty levels. Children could use tangible programming blocks
  to complete visual tasks shown on computer screen. To evaluate our tool, a user
  study was conducted with 10 children. Results of user study show that the tool
  could reduce children's cognitive load while solving the tasks and children are
  more interested in challenging tasks than easy tasks in our tool.
summary: "TLogic is a hands-on programming tool that lets young children (ages 6-8) snap together physical blocks to solve on-screen puzzles, making coding concepts tangible and playful. A study with 10 kids showed that the physical blocks lowered mental effort and that children naturally gravitated toward harder challenges, suggesting tangible interfaces can scaffold early problem-solving skills."
