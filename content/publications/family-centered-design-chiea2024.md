abstract: "This SIG brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss family-centered design approaches for technology research and practice. As technology becomes deeply embedded in family life, there is a growing need to consider how design processes can better account for the diverse needs, values, and dynamics within families."
summary: "This workshop gathers experts to develop practical methods for designing technology that works for entire families, not just individual users. It addresses the growing disconnect between how deeply technology is woven into family routines and how rarely design processes consider the perspectives of parents, children, and other family members together."
