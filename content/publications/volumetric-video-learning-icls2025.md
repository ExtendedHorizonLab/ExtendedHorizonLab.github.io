abstract: "Volumetric video (VV) has the potential to revolutionize traditional video-based learning (VBL) by offering immersive, 3D content that enhances student engagement and comprehension. However, the limited interactivity of current pre-recorded VV restricts its educational applications. To address this, we developed and evaluated an interactive VV viewing system that enables learners to engage with spatial interactive areas. These areas trigger multimodal outcomes and support both static and continuous interactions tailored to specific educational objectives. Compared to the basic condition (VV without interaction), the interactive VV condition demonstrated higher germane cognitive load and interest in learning but showed no significant differences in short-term memory retention."
summary: "This paper explores whether letting students interact with 3D video recordings in VR -- for example, tapping hotspots that trigger additional information -- improves learning compared to passively watching the same content. The interactive version boosted learner interest and deeper cognitive processing, pointing to a promising new format for educational video beyond flat screens."
