abstract: "Embodied communication, which uses physical cues to convey meaning and emotions, is essential for building social connections. In this work, we introduce SenseBot, an augmented reality (AR)-enabled robotic representative designed to facilitate embodied communication. SenseBot acts as a local agent for remote users, allowing them to engage more interactively and meaningfully with people on-site."
summary: "SenseBot is a small robot paired with augmented reality that stands in for a remote family member or friend, conveying their gestures and presence to the people in the room. It is especially aimed at bridging the gap between grandparents and grandchildren or other intergenerational pairs who live far apart, making long-distance conversations feel more physical and personal."
