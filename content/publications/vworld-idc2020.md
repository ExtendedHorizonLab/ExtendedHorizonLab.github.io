abstract: "The growing development and commercialization of Virtual Reality (VR) allow more children to get access to this technology. VR features a new, more emotional relevant experience with a sense of presence and high interactivity. In this paper, we present VWorld, an immersive VR system designed to boost children's creativity and computational thinking skill. VWorld enables children to create their own virtual world by putting 3D objects on a miniature map, then explore the world and control the chosen objects by constructing tangible programs."
summary: "VWorld lets children design a miniature 3D world, then step inside it through a VR headset and bring it to life by snapping together physical programming blocks. By combining world-building creativity with hands-on coding, the system aims to develop computational thinking in a way that feels more like play than traditional programming exercises."
