  Programming is an effective way to foster children's computational thinking.
  We present AR-Maze, which is a novel tangible programming tool using Augmented
  Reality (AR) technology for young children. AR-Maze superposes constant feedback
  on the physical world and maintains a positive, low-cost learning environment.
  Using this system, children could create their own programs by arranging
  programming blocks and debug or execute the code with a mobile device. In
  addition, they will be able to learn fundamental programming concepts, such as
  parameters, loop logic, debug, etc. We design and implement this system, as well
  as conduct a preliminary user study and analyze the results, which can guide a
  better design of AR-Maze. With this work, we intend to help children programming
  in an interesting and intuitive way.
summary: "AR-Maze is a tool that teaches young children to code by letting them arrange physical blocks to build programs, then using a phone or tablet to see their code come alive through augmented reality. A user study with children showed the system is both engaging and effective at teaching core programming ideas like loops and debugging."
