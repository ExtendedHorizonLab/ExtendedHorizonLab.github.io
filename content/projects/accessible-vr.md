This project explores novel interaction techniques and interface designs to make virtual reality experiences accessible to users with visual, motor, and cognitive disabilities.

## Overview

Virtual reality has tremendous potential for education, entertainment, and social connection. However, current VR systems often present significant barriers for users with disabilities. Our research addresses these challenges through:

- **Audio-based navigation**: Spatial audio cues that help blind users navigate virtual environments
- **Adaptive controllers**: Custom input devices that accommodate various motor abilities
- **Simplified interfaces**: Reduced cognitive load for users with cognitive disabilities

## Key Contributions

1. SoundScape VR: A fully audio-navigable virtual environment
2. FlexController: An adaptive VR controller for users with limited hand mobility
3. EasyVR: A simplified VR interface with reduced cognitive demands
