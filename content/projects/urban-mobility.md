Leveraging machine learning and large-scale urban data to understand and improve mobility patterns in cities.

## Overview

Understanding how people move through cities is crucial for urban planning, public health, and environmental sustainability. This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze large-scale mobility data and provide actionable insights for city planners.

## Research Areas

- **Mobility prediction**: Forecasting traffic patterns and pedestrian flows
- **Route optimization**: Finding efficient and equitable transit routes
- **Accessibility mapping**: Identifying barriers to mobility for people with disabilities

## Impact

Our work has been adopted by the City of Raleigh for transit planning and has contributed to improved bus routes serving underserved communities.
