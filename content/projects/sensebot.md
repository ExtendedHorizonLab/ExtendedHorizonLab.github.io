Embodied communication, which uses physical cues to convey meaning and emotions, is essential for building social connections. In this work, we introduce SenseBot, an augmented reality (AR)-enabled robotic representative designed to facilitate embodied communication. SenseBot acts as a local agent for remote users, allowing them to engage more interactively and meaningfully with people on-site.
