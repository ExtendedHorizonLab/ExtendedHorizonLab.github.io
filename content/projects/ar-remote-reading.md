Prior work has explored various technology designs to support intergenerational communications and connections through remote activities such as reading or play. However, few works have explored these technologies outside the family settings. In this work, we aimed to understand how technology can support social connectedness through remote activities, by investigating the use of a tablet-based AR system among older adult volunteers and students for remote reading. We developed the system based on insights from previous research, deployed the system in the field, and observed the use of the system over six months. With the data collected from the field, our work presents a rich description of the use of the system and the practices that emerged around its usage in a real-world setting. Our findings highlight the importance of supporting an engaging reading experience and context understanding for social connections with the technology design. We provide insights into how such technology can support intergenerational communication and foster social connectedness.
