Volumetric video (VV) has the potential to revolutionize traditional video-based learning (VBL) by offering immersive, 3D content that enhances student engagement and comprehension. However, the limited interactivity of current pre-recorded VV restricts its educational applications. To address this, we developed and evaluated an interactive VV viewing system that enables learners to engage with spatial interactive areas. These areas trigger multimodal outcomes and support both static and continuous interactions tailored to specific educational objectives. In this work, we utilized the Lego construction learning task as an exploratory case. Compared to the basic condition (VV without interaction), the interactive VV condition showed no significant differences in short-term memory retention but demonstrated higher germane cognitive load, perceived utility, usability, and interest in learning. These findings highlight the potential of interactive VV to enhance embodied learning.
