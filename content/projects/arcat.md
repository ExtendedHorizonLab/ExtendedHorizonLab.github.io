In this paper we present ARCat, a tangible programming tool designed to help children learn DFS algorithm with augmented reality technology. The tool help children use tangible programming cards to control a search process, rather than control visual characters directly. With the special design of tile semantics and real-time feedback, the cognitive load of the learning process had been proved to be affordable to children (ages 8-9) with the result of our preliminary evaluation, which shows the possibility of basic algorithm education for young children with the tangible interface.
