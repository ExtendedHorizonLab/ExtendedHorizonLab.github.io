Tangible user interfaces (TUIs) have been proved useful for children’s programming, which could develop children’s computational thinking. In this paper, we described TLogic, a tangible programming tool for children aged 6-8. The tool contains two parts: tangible programming blocks and visual tasks with different difficulty levels. Results of user study show that the tool could reduce children’s cognitive load while solving the tasks with complex logic. Besides, children are more interested in challenging tasks than easy tasks, such as sequential structure problems. Furthermore, we found that the design of tangible programming tool’s visual task is important for children’s cognitive development.
