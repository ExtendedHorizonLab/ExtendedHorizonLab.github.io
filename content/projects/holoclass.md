Virtual Reality (VR) enhances education by creating immersive and engaging learning environments. Volumetric video (VV) further improves VR classrooms by offering realistic, 3D representations of instructors and materials without high development costs. This study introduces HoloClass, a live VV streaming system for VR classrooms. We conducted interviews with 18 students to identify key design needs, resulting in features of HoloClass that support real-time awareness, classroom scalability, and note-taking. Our contributions include empirical insights into designing educational tools with live VV in VR classrooms and the implementation of features that enhance interaction and learning in a virtual setting.
