We are pleased to announce that our lab has received a $1.2 million grant from the National Science Foundation to support our Accessible Virtual Reality research program.

This three-year grant will fund the development of novel interaction techniques, hardware prototypes, and user studies to make virtual reality more accessible to people with disabilities.
